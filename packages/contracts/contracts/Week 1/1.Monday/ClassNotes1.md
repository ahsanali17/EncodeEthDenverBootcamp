# Day 1 - Blockchain Theory

- See blockchain in the context of decentralization and its systems
- Cryptographic techniques have been crucial for solving the problems in implementing decentralized systems
- Early electronic cash systems came part way to a practical implementation that could solve the double spend problem and achieve consensus across an open network.
- Ethereum successfully transitioned from Proof of work to Proof of Stake in 2022.

# Homework

Discuss in your teams what a decentralized version of a game like monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server?

Consider:
1. What are the essential pieces of functionality?
2. How would people cheat?
3. How could you prevent them from cheating?

This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do can detailed design.
